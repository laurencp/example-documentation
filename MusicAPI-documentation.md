# What is MusicAPI?

MusicAPI is a fictional API that I created while completing Peter Gruenbaum's Udemy course, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-swagger-and-the-open-api-specification/" target="_blank">'Learn Swagger and the Open API Specification'</a>. This course is the third in Gruenbaum's series on documenting APIs, and takes learners through the process of using Swagger to create a YAML file to document an API.

MusicAPI is an API that enables users to create and manage music playlists. 

# MusicAPI documentation

I created MusicAPI in the Swagger editor in YAML format, then used SwaggerHub to publish the API documentation. 

The MusicAPI documentation can be viewed via this link: <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/laurencp/MusicAPI1/0.3.0#/" target="_blank">MusicAPI</a>.
